# tic-tac-toe-solver

Notes on compiling and running:

1. It uses C++14 features, so compile using -std=c++14 with gcc/g++.
2. The tests directory contains unit tests for the Googletest framework. You can ignore it if you just want to run the program. If you want to run the tests, link in gtest_main.a and pthread, and make sure the compiler can find the gtest headers in one of your include directories.
